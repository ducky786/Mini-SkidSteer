# July 8-9th: Started on CAD

Recently I have come accross many videos of rc construction videos. And one cought my eye. It was a skidsteer by professorBoots on yt! I thought it would be perfect to kill bordom on my desk. I started CADing creating the design that revolved around a similar design as professerBoots. I changed most of the functionality to reduce the complexity. Started with the body which for right now houses 2 N20 motors. The skidsteer will be driven as a tank drive so the motors will be mounted in the back and the front wheels will be mounted to 5x11x4mm bearing. The back cover and the cab are going to be screwed in together so they can swing open for easy access. I am really happy on the cad so far because this is my first time cading something that doesnt look entierly like a Box! I think the main body of the skidsteer is complete and all thats left to do is add the arm along with servo mounting points. After Cad is done I will have to start working on a costom PCB that can fit inside the small body!
