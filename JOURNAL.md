# July 8-9th: Started on CAD

Recently I have come accross many videos of rc construction toys. And one cought my eye. It was a skidsteer by professorBoots on yt! I thought it would be perfect to kill bordom on my desk. I started CADing creating the design that revolved around a similar design as professerBoots. I changed most of the functionality to reduce the complexity. Started with the body which for right now houses 2 N20 motors. The skidsteer will be driven as a tank drive so the motors will be mounted in the back and the front wheels will be mounted to 5x11x4mm bearing. The back cover and the cab are going to be screwed in together so they can swing open for easy access. I am really happy on the cad so far because this is my first time cading something that doesnt look entierly like a Box! I think the main body of the skidsteer is complete and all thats left to do is add the arm along with servo mounting points. After Cad is done I will have to start working on a costom PCB that can fit inside the small body!

Front Axel: The axel goes through bearings and cliped down to the body with a C-clip

# July 26-27: Finished CADing!!

I finally finished the CADing on my skidstear. I added the two arms and the bucket!. Both the arm and the bucket are powerd by 2 sg90 motors. I was consernced if the servo would be able to move the weight of the arm + the load so I added gears to increase the torque. The servo is connected to a 10 teeth gear wich drives a 22 teeth servo. 2.2 : 1 gear ratio. At the bucket, the connected servo controles the tilt of the bucket! The bucket is connect with 2M screws. The Right arm is connect with another C-clips, just like the axils in the front and the Left arm is connected with 2M screws which screw to the gear. Now that I have finished the CAD I am going to start on a PCB which will house the ESP-32, the motor dirvers and the battery! I am also considering on using LEDs to add a little more ummph to the Skidstear. After finishing the PCB I might also change the cab of the skid stear to inlude the tradintional holes that the actual skidsteers have.

Full design!
